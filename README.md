# Pavlov-UGC-Migrator
Small tool that helps you move assets from a migrated UGC folder to a freshly generated one.

Unreal Engine 4's file and folder moving functionality is both slow and occasionally breaks file links for some users. This can make moving large amounts of files between folders a real nightmare. This tool helps move a collection of files from one UGC folder to another outside of Unreal more quickly and safely than you can in-engine.

Generate a new UGC folder in a fresh Pavlov Template project and copy+paste your folder to merge from another project (or use asset migration) into the fresh project. Enter the merged/migrated UGC folder path into the tool, and then your destination newly generated UGC folder (you can drag these folders onto the window to quickly type out the filepath).

This tool is certainly far from perfect, so expect potential errors. Please ensure that the filepath to your project is as short as you can make it. Send any significant bug reports to superdirtlover99@gmail.com (yes, really).
